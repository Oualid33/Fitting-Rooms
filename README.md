# Fitting-Rooms

Problem Description:

The men's fitting rooms in a clothing store have undergone renovation, so men and women must share temporary the same fittings rooms of women.

To avoid problems, when women are in the fitting rooms, men cannot access and vice versa.
A slide on the door indicates one of the three following state:
- Empty,
- Occupied by men, or
- Occupied by women.

When fitting rooms are occupied by men (women resp.), then men (women resp.) can access.
